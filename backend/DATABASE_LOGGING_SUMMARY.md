# Database Logging Implementation Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the database connection configuration with comprehensive logging to monitor database connectivity, performance, and health status.

## Added Features

### 1. Database Connection Logging
- **Startup Logging**: Logs when Prisma Client initializes for both development and production environments
- **Connection Testing**: Automatic connection test on startup with success/failure logging
- **Environment Awareness**: Different log levels and messages for development vs production

### 2. Prisma Event Logging
Enhanced Prisma Client with event-based logging for:
- **Query Logging**: Logs all database queries with execution time, parameters, and target information
- **Error Logging**: Captures database errors with context
- **Info Logging**: Database information messages (e.g., connection pool status)
- **Warning Logging**: Database warnings and potential issues

### 3. Database Health Monitoring
- **Health Check Function**: `checkDatabaseHealth()` function that tests database connectivity
- **Performance Metrics**: Measures and logs database response times
- **Status Reporting**: Returns detailed health status (healthy/unhealthy) with timestamps

### 4. Enhanced Health Endpoint
Updated `/health` endpoint to include:
- Database connectivity status
- Database response time
- Application uptime
- Memory usage
- Environment information
- Version information

### 5. Graceful Shutdown Logging
Enhanced process handlers for:
- `SIGINT` signal (Ctrl+C)
- `SIGTERM` signal
- `beforeExit` event

All shutdown events now log the disconnection process for better monitoring.

## Log Output Examples

### Successful Startup
```
info: Initializing Prisma Client for development environment with query logging
info: Database Info: Starting a postgresql pool with 17 connections
info: ✅ Database connection established successfully
debug: Database Query: SELECT 1 as test (duration: 288ms)
info: ✅ Database query test successful
info: Server started successfully
```

### Database Query Logging
```
debug: Database Query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1 
{
  "params": ["user123"],
  "duration": "45ms",
  "target": "quaint::connector::metrics"
}
```

### Health Check Response
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-07T07:50:10.295Z",
  "uptime": 4.453259833,
  "memory": {...},
  "database": {
    "status": "healthy",
    "responseTime": 279,
    "timestamp": "2025-09-07T07:50:10.295Z"
  },
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "development"
}
```

### Graceful Shutdown
```
info: Received SIGINT signal, shutting down gracefully...
info: Database connection closed
```

## Configuration Changes

### Files Modified
1. **`/src/config/database.js`** - Enhanced with comprehensive logging
2. **`/src/server.js`** - Updated health endpoint with database status

### New Features Added
- Database connection testing on startup
- Prisma event listeners for all log levels
- Health check function for monitoring
- Enhanced shutdown logging

## Benefits
- **Monitoring**: Better visibility into database performance and connectivity
- **Debugging**: Detailed query logging for development troubleshooting
- **Health Checks**: Real-time database status monitoring
- **Production Ready**: Appropriate logging levels for production environments
- **Graceful Handling**: Proper connection cleanup and logging on shutdown

## Usage
- Access health status: `GET /health`
- Logs are written to both console (development) and log files
- Database health can be monitored via the health endpoint
- All database operations are logged with performance metrics
